## 📋 Changelog

### 2026-01-05: Data Population Strategy Implementation

**Problem Solved**: STATE field was being incorrectly derived from Maidenhead grid squares, which is unreliable for portable operators (e.g., POTA activators operating from a different state than their license).

**Changes Made**:

1. **Backend (Rust)**:
   - Added `lookup_call_full()` function returning DXCC, COUNTRY, CONT, CQZ, ITUZ from callsign prefix
   - Updated `insert_qso_from_wsjtx()` to populate CQZ/ITUZ at QSO time
   - Removed `grid_to_state()` call from decode events
   - Deprecated `grid_to_state()` function with documentation explaining why

2. **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**:
   - Updated `BandActivity.tsx` to show continent instead of (unreliable) state
   - Removed "NEW STATE" detection from live decodes (unreliable)
   - Added `continent`, `cqz`, `ituz` fields to decode events

3. **Data Strategy (Tiered)**:
   - **Tier 1 (At QSO time)**: Callsign prefix → DXCC, COUNTRY, CQZ, ITUZ, CONT
   - **Tier 2 (LoTW sync)**: STATE, CNTY filled from confirmations (authoritative)
   - **Tier 3 (Future)**: POTA_REF parsing, QRZ API for non-LoTW stations

**Why This Matters**:
- WAS award requires LoTW-confirmed STATE anyway
- Portable operators (POTA, SOTA) send grids from operating location, not license address
- 4-char grids are ~100×200km and can span multiple states
- LoTW is the authoritative source for award credit

See `CLAUDE.md` section "Data Population Strategy" for full documentation.

## 🔴 CURRENT SPRINT - Active QSO Bugs (v0.2.1)

### Issue 1: RX Messages Not Showing in Active QSO Panel

**Problem:** When in a QSO, messages FROM the other station (RX) are not appearing in the Active QSO message log, even though they ARE being decoded and shown in Band Activity.

**Expected Behavior:** When KB9FIN sends "N5JKK KB9FIN -12", that message should appear in the Active QSO panel as an RX message.

**Current State:** Only TX messages appear. The Active QSO panel shows our outgoing transmissions but not incoming replies.

**Key Code Location:** `src/components/ActiveQso.tsx` - the `wsjtx-decode` listener (around line 300+)

**Root Cause Analysis (based on TX fix):**

The TX messages weren't appearing because of a flawed comparison check. The old code used:
```tsx
// OLD BROKEN CODE
const lastTxRef = useRef<string>("");
// ...
if (isTransmitting && txMsg !== lastTxRef.current) {
  lastTxRef.current = txMsg;
  // Add message
}
```

**Why it failed:** `lastTxRef` was NEVER cleared between TX cycles, so when the same message was transmitted again (e.g., repeated CQ calls), the comparison `txMsg !== lastTxRef.current` was FALSE and the message was never added.

**The TX Fix (apply similar pattern to RX):**
Changed to edge detection - detect when transmission STARTS (rising edge):
```tsx
// NEW WORKING CODE
const wasTransmittingRef = useRef(false);
// ...
const txJustStarted = isTransmitting && !wasTransmittingRef.current;
wasTransmittingRef.current = isTransmitting;

if (txJustStarted && txMsg) {
  // Add message - no comparison needed, just detect TX start
}
```

**For RX Fix:** Check if there's similar filtering logic preventing RX messages from being added. The decode listener should:
1. Check if the message is directed at us (`decode.dx_call === myCall`)
2. Add it to messages array via `addMessage("rx", ...)`
3. Verify no duplicate prevention is blocking valid messages
4. Verify `myCall` is being set correctly from heartbeat

**Debug Steps:**
1. Add console.log in the decode listener to see if RX messages ARE being received
2. Check the `addMessage()` function for any filtering (there's a dedupe check)
3. Verify `myCall` is populated before decodes arrive
4. Check if `decode.dx_call` matches `myCall` (case sensitivity?)

---

### Issue 2: QSO Not Being Auto-Logged

**Problem:** When a QSO completes (RR73/73 exchange), the QSO is not being automatically logged to the database.

**Expected Behavior:** After receiving RR73 or 73 from the other station, and having exchanged reports, the QSO should auto-log.

**Root Cause:** Almost certainly caused by Issue #1 above. The auto-log logic depends on:
```tsx
// Auto-log when QSO complete
useEffect(() => {
  if (state.mode === "qso_complete" && !state.logged && state.dxCall && state.rstRcvd) {
    logQso(state);
  }
}, [state.mode, state.logged, state.dxCall, state.rstRcvd, logQso]);
```

**Why it fails:**
1. `state.mode` never transitions to `"qso_complete"` because RX messages aren't being processed
2. `state.rstRcvd` is never populated (again, RX processing issue)
3. Both conditions fail → no auto-log

**The QSO Complete Detection (current code):**
```tsx
// Check for QSO complete (RR73/73)
if (msg.includes("RR73") || msg.includes("RRR") || msg.match(/\b73\b/)) {
  if (prev.rstRcvd || theirReport) {
    newState.mode = "qso_complete";
  }
}
```

This requires `rstRcvd` to be set from processing RX messages correctly.

**Fix Order:**
1. Fix RX message display (Issue #1)
2. Verify rstRcvd is being extracted via `extractReport()`
3. Verify mode transitions to "qso_complete" on 73/RR73
4. QSO should then auto-log

---

## Key Insight from TX Fix

**Don't compare current message to previous message to decide whether to add it.**

Instead, detect STATE TRANSITIONS (e.g., `transmitting: false→true`) and add the message at that moment.

For RX, there's no "was receiving" state - each decode is a discrete event. The issue is likely:
- Filtering that's too aggressive
- `myCall` not set when decode arrives
- Case mismatch in callsign comparison
- The `addMessage` dedupe logic blocking valid messages

## 🔴 Critical Gaps (Remaining)

### 1. LoTW Upload (BLOCKED - Must Test First)
**IMPORTANT**: Upload functionality is intentionally NOT implemented yet.
We must never submit test data to LoTW. Only real QSO data can be uploaded.
- [ ] Queue QSOs for upload
- [ ] Integration with TQSL for signing
- [ ] Track upload status (pending/uploaded/failed)
- [ ] Batch upload support

### 2. Award Progress Dashboard
**Why Critical**: Visual motivation is the killer feature
- [x] get_dxcc_progress command (worked/confirmed counts)
- [x] get_was_progress command (state lists)
- [ ] DXCC progress UI: X/340 worked, Y confirmed (by band/mode)
- [ ] WAS progress UI: X/50 worked, Y confirmed
- [ ] VUCC progress: grid squares on 6m+
- [ ] USA-CA progress: counties
- [ ] Progress bars with targets

### 3. QSO Map Visualization
**Why Critical**: Visual gratification, better than QSOmap.org
- [ ] World map with QSO pins
- [ ] Color coding: worked vs confirmed
- [ ] Filter by band/mode/date range
- [ ] Grid square overlay for VUCC
- [ ] US state map for WAS
- [ ] Azimuthal projection centered on home QTH

## Data Source Philosophy

### Why NOT CTY.DAT?
- Maintained by single person (Jim Reisert AD1C)
- No versioning, no API
- No guarantee of longevity
- Most ham software blindly trusts it

### Our Approach
1. **Curated DXCC entities** - Version-controlled JSON from ARRL official list
2. **ITU prefix allocations** - Official international prefix blocks
3. **LoTW as ground truth** - Confirmations include DXCC entity number
4. **Club Log API** (future) - Quality database with edge cases

### Reference Data Updates
- DXCC list changes ~1-2x per year with ARRL announcements
- We will version these changes in Git
- Users can update via app settings or manual download

---

## Technical Debt

### Cleanup Items
- [ ] Remove unused imports (Rust compiler warnings)
- [ ] Add proper error types instead of String errors
- [ ] Implement proper logging (tracing crate)
- [ ] Add unit tests for core logic
- [ ] Add integration tests for Tauri commands

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Index optimization for QSO queries by date range
- [ ] Lazy loading for large QSO lists
- [ ] Background processing for LoTW sync
